## Testfit switches
I did not want to hot glue my mechanical switches on the front panel. My plan was to find the right hole size for them to snap in place and tightly fit.

## Testfit fepi Z 2
Using a 5mm thick material for my rear panel, I found that the FePi jacks did not stick out all the way through, which caused my jack cables to not snap in place (they kept falling off).
My plan was to carve out some material with laser engraving, to have the jacks at the surface of my prototype.
I used this testfile on some 5mm Okoum√© plywood, iteratively until I found the perfect speed and power to properly carve out some space for the FePi.
