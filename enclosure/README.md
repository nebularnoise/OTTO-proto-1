# Enclosure
These are the files used for cutting the enclosure with my local hackerspace's lasercutter.
The enclosure is made from 3mm regular plywood and 5mm Okoumé plywood.
It uses box joints all around. The back panel and the side panels are glued together. The front panel tightly fits on top, and is held in place by tiny magnets.

The SVG files were later converted to dxf, then imported into the lasercutting software, where power and speed was fine-tuned for each piece.

## Why 3mm *AND* 5mm ?
I wanted some nice looking material for the overall enclosure, and something sturdy, so i settled for 5mm thick Okoumé plywood for the sides and back.
For the front panel, however, I noticed my encoders' threaded shaft barely made it through a 3mm material for the nut to fit. Using 5mm thick material was out of the question.

This disparity caused me to rescale the box joints on the side panels: 
 - 5mm long joints for the connection to the other side panels and the back panel
 - 3mm long joints for the connection with the front panel.

## Why magnets ?
Magnets are cool. :sunglasses:

## Notes on engraving

Engraving is used for two purposes here:
- Aesthetics :lipstick:
- Carving out some material for the FePi to properly fit :hammer: (More on that [here](tests))
